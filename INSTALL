tarix is a fairly simple program and should work on any system with an ANSI
C compiler that suports GNU-ish 64-bit integers ([unsigned] long long,
strtoull).  If it doesn't, please report it as a bug!

To compile tarix, simply type make (or gmake if your make program is not GNU
make) from the base directory of the source distribution.  Running make
install will install tarix to /usr/local by default, but this can be changed
by editing the variables at the top of the Makefile.
