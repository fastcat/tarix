Currently tarix targets POSIX standard and GNU tar archives.  It does
not try to support some of the fancier GNU tar extensions, such as
sparse files or multi-volume archives, although it may work with them
anyways, since it only looks at the file headers within the archive.

Do not put newlines in your filenames, it *WILL* break tarix's index format
(and probably lots of other things too).

It can handle arbitrarily long filenames using the GNU extensions.

It can handle GNU's listed incremental archives (there is nothing special
about them, all of the special is contained in the incremental listing).

Jorg Schilling's star appears to use many of the same extensions as GNU tar,
so it should work fine, but I have not tested it.

Basic tests have been done with BSD tar from FreeBSD and they appear to
work.

If you test it out with another version of tar, please let me know if it
works or not.  If it doesn't, I'll try to fix it.

Tarix's format uses 32 bit unsigned integers to count 512 byte blocks, so it
can handle archives up to 2 terabytes uncompressed, beyond that failures
will occur.  Enabling compression won't help.
