TODO items, AKA desired features

* tarix should autodetect input in extract mode and choose lseek or mt mode
  without user input.
* error messages from zlib may be reported as i/o errors "Success"
* expose volume header records as a symlink or other such construct in the
  fuse mount
* Glob mode should have a ** or ends-with mode.  This isn't something that
  fnmatch implements natively, however, so we'd have to do it with string
  processing and repeated calls to fnmatch, which would be ugly and possibly
  slow.
