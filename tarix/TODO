TODO items, AKA desired features

* tarix should autodetect input in extract mode and choose lseek or mt mode
  without user input.
* error messages from zlib may be reported as i/o errors "Success"
* expose volume header records as a symlink or other such construct in the
  fuse mount
* Extract mode should have an option to treat arguments as globs instead of
  prefixes
* Extract mdoe should have an option to treat arguments as "none of these"
  instead of "any of these", this should play nice with the glob mode.
