Tarix supports compressing the tar file with zlib (a.k.a. gzip).  To
enable this mode, use the -z option, and optionally a compression level
(e.g. -9 for max compression).

Tarix will specially construct the output so that it is compatible with
gzip, but also so that tarix can have sufficient random access within
the file to perform selective extraction.

When extracting the compressed archive, you can either decompress it first,
or use the -z option to work directly with the compressed archive.  If you
decompress it first, you do not need to re-index the archive, the original
index will already contain the information needed.

Even though the compressed archive will be compatible with gzip (and tar
-zx), you will not be able to simply gzip an archive (or create it with tar
-cz) and use it with tarix.  Gzip/tar won't include the synchronization
points tarix needs for random access.
