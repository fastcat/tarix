Tarix is a fairly simple program and should work on any system with an ANSI
C compiler that suports GNU-ish 64-bit integers ([unsigned] long long,
strtoull).  If you are not compiling on a known supported platform, you will
probably have to modify src/portability.h to get correct defines for 64-bit
file operations correct, and src/portability.c to get correct
implementations of the magnetic tape setblk/seek/tell operations.  If this
is not sufficient, please report it as a bug!

To compile tarix, simply type make (or gmake if your make program is not GNU
make) from the base directory of the source distribution.  Running make
install will install tarix to /usr/local by default, but this can be changed
by editing the variables at the top of the Makefile.

Tarix requires the zlib headers and library.

There is also an optional FUSE program to mount indexed archives.  Building
the FUSE helper requires the fuse headers and libraries, and the glib-2.0
headers and libraries.  If these are missing or cannot be found, the build
process will tell you that it cannot build the fuse helper.

Known Supported Platforms:
	Linux
	FreeBSD
	Cygwin (no magnetic tape or fuse support)
